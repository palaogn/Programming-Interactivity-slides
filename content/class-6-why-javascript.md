## Why Javascript?

Note:
- Why do we need to learn javascript.
- And why do we need to add it to our nice looking HTML + CSS page. Can I not just create web pages with HTML and CSS.
- Well technically you can, but it would be hard to add any interactivity
- We could not create Instagram without javascript.

## Roles

***HTML*** - What it says

***CSS*** - How it looks

***Javascript*** - How it behaves

Note:
- HTML provides structure, CSS styles it, but javascript bring a webpage to life with interactivity and dynamic updates.

### What can javascipt do for your webpage?

<div style="text-align: left;">

- ***Interactivity***: enables feature like clickable buttons, interactive forms and content updates
- ***Dynamic content***: Can update content that user sees based on action, can show personalised message
- ***Data fetching***: Can fetch external data, browser data

</div>
Note:
- Interactivity: enables feature like clickable buttons, interactive forms and content updates. Something happens when you click a button, shows a popup about a promo code you can use. You are scrolled up as you have an error in your input form.
- Dynamic content: Can update content that user sees based on action, can show personalised message.
- Data fetching: Can fetch external data, browser data. Lets say you are looking at at news page, then the data you see will be fetched with javascript. Perhaps your location is also fetched from your browser to show personalised content.

<!-- ### HTML + CSS    vs    HTML + CSS + Javascript -->
<div style="text-align: left;">

#### HTML + CSS
Can make a static page without any real-time changes.

#### vs.

#### HTML + CSS + JavaScript
JavaScript can react to user actions, update data in real time, and interact with BE to retrieve data.

Can react to user inputs, such as mouse move, click, keypress

Note:
- What is the difference between HTML + CSS and HTML + CSS + JavaScript
- HTML + CSS, Can make a statis page without any real-time changes. Like we just created last week.
- HTML + CSS + JavaScript on the other hand can react to user actions, update data in real time and interact with BE services to retrieve data.
- It also enchanges the user experience by responding immediately to user inputs. Such as mouse move, clicks, keypresses and other actions.

### Javascript can be used client side and server side

- JavaScript is widely used for client-side scripting, meaning that it is executed by web browsers on the client’s computer rather than on the server.

- Javascript can also be used for server side

Note:
- It is widely used for client-side scripting, meaning that it is executed by web browsers on the client’s computer rather than on the server.
- Javascript can also be used for server side scripting with the help of platforms like Node.js a platform that allows developers to run JavaScript on the server side.
- JavaScript is a versatile language that can be used for various applications.

## What can javascript do?

- Interact with user inputs (mouse, keydown, click)
- Change content dynamically on user action
- Fetch data to display
- Change data depending on action (change sections)
- Autocomplete
- Validate inputs
- .....

Note:
- Change content dynamically on user action. It can for example change what content you see. Show you modal on click.
- Fetch dynamic data
- Autocomplete. For example if you are typing in a input box and you will get autocomplete suggestions at the bottom. That's javascript filtering possible inputs depending on your input.
- Validate user inputs. Simple inputs validations can be done with just html but more advanced validation for example to validate two fields together needs javascript.
- It is also essentials for other frameworks or libraries used to build webpages today such as React, Vue, Angular, Next

### Javascript is essential for creating interactive web pages

Note:
- To sum it up
- Javascript is essential building block for creating interactive web pages.
