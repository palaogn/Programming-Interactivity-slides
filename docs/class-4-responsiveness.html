## RWD Basics

---

### Iphone announcement 2007

<img src="attachment/c1/iphone.png" />

Note:
- As we talked about in class 1, the first iphone was released in 2009
- And after that the term Responsive Web Design was created in 2010.

### RWD - Responsive Web design

Responsive Web Design

by Ethan Marcotte 2010

<img src="attachment/c1/all_sizes.png" />

Note: 
- And after that the term Responsive Web Design was created in 2010.

---

## Mobile Web Usage growing

<img src="attachment/c4/mobile-web-growing.png" />

Note: 
- Here we can see the usage of desktop and mobiles in a graph that goes from 2007 to 2015, with an interesting cut off point at 2014
- I could not find a newer graph then this, but I guess the gap might have even gotten bigger.

---

### Responsive viewport

``` css
<head>

...
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">

</head>

```

The viewport meta tag ensures the page displays correctly on smaller screens

Note: 
- You might have noticed this meta tag that is automatically added in the CodeSandbox projects.
- When the first smart phone came out, web pages where not ready to be responsive. So a quick fix for this was for the browsers to scale the page down.
- This is a tag that all web pages should have. It gives the browser instructions on how to control the page's dimensions and scaling.
- On mobile devices, if this tag is missing, browsers might automatically scale the page, causing content to be too small or improperly laid out.

---

## Methodology

---

#### Responsive web design (RWD) or responsive design 

<div style="text-align: left;">

is an approach to web design that aims to make web pages render well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes from minimum to maximum display size to ensure usability and satisfaction

</div>


---

### Screens

![devices](attachment/devices.png)

Note:
- As today we have many screen sizes to think about.
- We have the desktop, a big desktop, tablet, mobile phone, vertical tablet, vertical mobile 

---

### Screens

![devices plus watch](attachment/devices-watch.png)

Note:
- And there are even more

---

### Screens

![android vs ios sizes](attachment/android-ios-sizes.png)

Note:
- There is also not just couple of sizes of phones and tablets.
- There is a device for every size

---

## "There is no mobile tablet or desktop"

Note:
- There is no mobile tablet or desktop
- We have all sizes and this has made responsive web design a bit tricky


---

![alt text](attachment/device-sizes.png)

Note:
- At one point it was possible to just add couple of breakpoints for the main sizes but now it kind of needs to flow correctly in all sizes.

---

![alt text](attachment/content-is-like-water.png)

Note: 
- Now we have to let it flow in every size

---

### Shall we look at some rsponsive sites

Note:
- Lets look at some responsive sites
- If you remember any cool sites, then please share.

---

<img src="attachment/c4/start-small.png" width="600px"/>

Note: 
- It can be a good approach to start developing for a mobile page and then adjust when it gets bigger

---

<section data-background-image="attachment/c4/start-small1.png" data-background-size="cover">

Note: Start small.

---

<section data-background-image="attachment/c4/start-small2.png" data-background-size="cover">

Note: Increase the width

---


<section data-background-image="attachment/c4/start-small4.png" data-background-size="cover">

Note: Add a breakpoint and fix it

---

<section data-background-image="attachment/c4/start-small5.png" data-background-size="cover">

Note: Keep going

---

## 03/ Layouts

---

### Max width

Great for flexible wrappers, to contain how far out they scale.

---

### Max width

``` CSS
main { 
    max-width: 800px;
    width: 100%;
}
```

---

## 04/ Media Queries

---

## Media

Add breakpoints to your CSS, at a certain viewport width.

---

### Media

``` css
@media (max-width: 480px) {
  /*  Mobile phone size */
}

@media (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 768px) {
  /* Tablet size */
}

@media (min-width: 769px) {
  /* Desktop size */
}
```

---

## Media

Media queries can be used to check many things, such as:
- Width and height of the viewport
- Width and height of the device
- Orientation (is the tablet/phone in landscape or portrait mode?)
- Resolution


---

### Lets try it

---

## CSS Grid

---

### What is CSS Grid

- CSS grid is a two dimensional layout system
- Provides ways to handle rows and columns in web design

---

### Grid template rows and columns

``` css
grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr;
grid-template-rows: auto 1fr auto;

```

Note:
- We are going to look at how we can use these 2 lines to create a layout for our page

---

### grid-template-rows

``` css
.page {
   display: grid;
   grid-template-rows:  80px 1fr 80px;
}

<div class=”content”>
   <header>Header</header>
   <main>Content</main>
   <footer>Footer</footer>
</div>
```

<img src="attachment/c4/grid1.png" height="300px" />

Note: 
- Here we have grid-template-rows
- the display: grid property always has to first be added so other grid attributes can be used
- this is an example of how we can create a basic layout of a page with fixed heights for header and footer 

---

### grid-template-columns

``` css
.tileContainer {
   display: grid;
   grid-template-columns:  1fr 1fr 1fr;
   grid-gap: 5px;
}

<div class=”tile-container”>
    <div>Tile 1</div>
    <div>Tile 2</div>
    <div>Tile 3</div>
</div>
```
<img src="attachment/c4/grid2.png" height="100px" />

Note: 
- Here we have a grid-template-colums
- This can be used to create columns layout, for example for grid layouts
- Here we are saying that we have 3 tiles, and each take 1/3 of the size
- 

---

### grid-template-columns

``` css
.tile-container {
   display: grid;
   grid-template-columns:  1fr 1fr 1fr;
}

<div class="tile-container">
  <div>Tile 1</div>
  <div>Tile 2</div>
  .....
  <div>Tile 9</div>
</div>
```

<img src="attachment/c4/grid3.png" height="200px">

Note:
- Here we have a grid column template and 9 divs
- It says 3 columns n each line, which will result in this

---

### gap controle

<div style="text-align: left;">

grid-gap

grid-row-gap

grid-column-gap

<img src="attachment/c4/grid4.png" height="400px">

Note:
- these are the different gaps we can use
- note that this image has a grid with no gaps

---

### grid-gap: 20px;

This will add a gap between all grids

<img src="attachment/c4/grid5.png" height="400px">

---

### grid-row-gap: 10px;

This will add a gap between rows

<img src="attachment/c4/grid6.png" height="400px">

---

### grid-column-gap: 10px;

This will add a gap between columns

<img src="attachment/c4/grid7.png" height="400px">

---

### different gap between row and column

``` css
grid-row-gap: 10px;
grid-column-gap: 60px;

```

<img src="attachment/c4/grid8.png" height="400px">

---

### Units

``` css
1fr - one part of available fractions
auto - just the space the element needs 
10% - percentage
100px - takes exactly 100px
```

<img src="attachment/c4/grid9.png" height="400px">

Note:
- These are examples of units we can use with the grid templates.


---

### Repeat

``` css
{
  display: grid;
 grid-template-columns:  repeat(3, 1fr); /* (how many, size) */
}

/* Is the same as: */
grid-template-columns:  1fr 1fr 1fr;

```

<img src="attachment/c4/grid10.png" height="400px">

Note:
- We define (how many, what size)

---

### auto-fit or auto-fill

``` css
{
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns:  repeat(auto-fit , 150px);
}

```

<img src="attachment/c4/grid-auto-1.gif" height="400px">

Note:
- instead of saying how many should repeat, we can use auto-fit or auto-fill

---

### repeat - auto-fit - minmax(150px, 1fr)

``` css
{
  display: grid;
 grid-template-columns:  repeat( auto-fit , minmax(150px, 1fr));
                      /* repeat (how many tiles, 150px-1fr) */
}
```

<img src="attachment/c4/grid-auto-2.gif" height="400px">

Note:
- Here we will repeat tiles, autofit and minmax the size

---

### Lets try it!

## Excercise

Note:
- The excercise today will be a combination of some media queries and css grid.
- I will give you the start code and then you can also play along with it
