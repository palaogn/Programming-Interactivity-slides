## 01/ Weekly Project 2 presentations

Note:
- If you want to, you can also show us your Class project 9 with the animations. It might be fun to share the last animation that you got to create yourselves.

---

## 02/ What is Canvas

---

### What is HTML canvas element

`<canvas>` is an HTML element for drawing graphics using javascript

It's a blank rectangle where you can draw shaped, images and more

Note:
- A `<canvas>` tag is exactly like an `<img>` tag, with the difference that instead of loading the image of pixels, you can draw it yourself with javascript code. 
- You can draw lines, circles, filled polygons and gradients. You can also redraw the canvas content in a loop to make an animation.

---

### Rendering basic blank `<canvas>`

``` js
<canvas id="myCanvas" width="500" height="500"></canvas>
```

Note:
- here is how you can render a html canvas. This is just an HTML tag.

---

<img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1000/1*6v8NifqESEqBdw9Ai9RR6Q.jpeg">

Note:
- This is basically what we are doing.
- This is a blank canvas, 500px by 500px and then we can draw on it using javascript.

---

### What can canvas be used for

To draw pixels programmatically, can also be done by user input for example the good old Paint

<img src="attachment/c11/canvas2.gif" width="500px">


Note:
- we can use it tp draw pixels programatically. Canvas is just a matrix of pixels or a blank box of pixels
- Here is an example of a canvas, that draws circles every time a user moves the mouse. And this is an example of a project we are going to do later.
---

## 02/ Canvas Line Drawing methods

Note:
- Today we are mainly going to go trough how we can draw some shapes on a canvas. And we will start with lines.

---

### Canvas context

``` js
<canvas id="myCanvas" width="500" height="500"></canvas>

const canvas = document.getElementById("myCanvas");
const canvasContext = canvas.getContext("2d");
```

- We are going to look at "2d"

- But there are also `webgl`, `webgl2`, `webgpu`, `bitmaprenderer`

Note:
- Here is how we can get the canvas context, that provides us many methods to draw on the canvas. We are just going to use the "2d" canvas context.
- There are also more context types, such as webgl, for three dimensional rendering context
- webgl2, webgpu and bitmaprenderer context. But there is a whole other another class covering webgl
- Here we are just consentrating in 2d, to practise some javascript and seeing what possibilities we have there to draw 2d on user interactions.

---

###  Line drawing methods

<div style="text-align: left;">

- ***beginPath()*** - starts a new path, should always be used between shapes
- ***moveTo(x, y)*** - moves the starting point for the path to the specified (x, y)
- ***lineTo(x, y)*** - Draws a line from the current position to the (x, y) position


Note:
- the 2d context provides us these methods to draw lines.
- beginPath - starts a new path, and should always be used at the start of a new shape. It will start a new path and effectively "reset" the current path so you can draw without connecting to the previous path.
- moveTo - moves the starting point for the path to the specified coordinates
- lineTo -  Draws a line from the current position to the (x, y) position

---

###  Line drawing methods

<div style="text-align: left;">

- ***stroke()*** - Strokes (outlines) the path with the current stroke color
- ***fill()*** - Fills the path with the current fill colors if it is closed

Note:

- stroke - that outlines the path with the current stroke color, or basically draws up our line
- fill - fills the path with the current fill colors, if its closed

---

###  Line drawing methods

``` js
canvasContext.beginPath();
canvasContext.moveTo(0, 0);
canvasContext.lineTo(200, 100);
canvasContext.stroke();
```

<img src="attachment/c11/line.png">

Note:
- This will create a straight line from 0,0 to 200,100

---

## 03/ Canvas Shape Drawing methods


---

### Draw triangle



``` js
canvasContext.beginPath();
canvasContext.moveTo(50, 150); // Start at (50,150)
canvasContext.lineTo(150, 150); // Line to (150,150)
canvasContext.lineTo(100, 50); // Line to (100,50)
canvasContext.closePath(); // Closes path to form a triangle

canvasContext.fillStyle = "green";
canvasContext.fill(); // Fills the triangle
canvasContext.stroke(); // Outlines the triangle
```

<img src="attachment/c11/triangle.png" height="200px" >

Note:
- We can also use the line drawing method to draw all kinds of shapes
- Here is an example of how we can draw a triangle
- We can then either use the stroke() method to create outlines or we can use the fill() method to fill the triangle.

---


### Draw rectangle / square

<div style="text-align: left;">

***rect(x, y, width, height)*** Defines a rectangle

***fillRect(x, y, width, height):*** Draws a filled rectangle.

***strokeRect(x, y, width, height):*** Draws the outline of a rectangle.


</div>

Note:
- To draw a rectangle we have couple of methods.
- fillRect that draws a filled rectangle
- strokeRect that draws outlines of a rectangle

---

### rect()

``` js
canvasContext.beginPath();
canvasContext.rect(10,10, 150,100);
canvasContext.stroke();
```

***rect(x, y, width, height)*** Defines a rectangle

<img src="attachment/c11/rect-stroke.png" height="200px" >

Note:
- Starts at x 10 and y 10. 150 wide by 100 height
- The rectangle method does just define the path so we need to use stroke() or fill() to actually draw it.

---

### fill Rect()

``` js
canvasContext.fillStyle = "blue";
canvasContext.fillRect(10, 10, 100, 50);

```

fillRect(x, y, width, height): Draws a filled rectangle.

<img src="attachment/c11/rect-fill.png" height="200px" >

Note:
- x is the x coordinate of the upper-left corner of the rectangle
- y is the y coordinate of the upper
- Will draw and fill it
- the fill is black by default


---

### stroke Rect()

``` js
canvasContext.strokeStyle = "red";
canvasContext.lineWidth = 3;
canvasContext.strokeRect(130, 10, 100, 50);

```

***strokeRect(x, y, width, height):*** Draws the outline of a rectangle.

<img src="attachment/c11/rect-stroke.png" height="200px" >

Note:
- Here is an example of a strokeRect, that will draw outlines of a rectangle
- Its the same as rect() with just the stroke()


---

### Draw circle

``` js
canvasContext.beginPath();
canvasContext.arc(x, y, radius, 0, Math.PI * 2); // Full circle with radius 50
canvasContext.stroke();
```

***arc(x, y, radius, startAngle, endAngle)*** - Draws an arc with a specific radius between two tangent points.

<img src="attachment/c11/circle-stroke.png" height="200px" >

Note:
- x, and y will be in the center of the circle. Circle will draw around it as far as the radius is. So radius is technically half of the circle height or width

---

### Additional methods

---

### Fillstyle, strokestyle and lineWidth methods

``` js
canvasContext.fillStyle = "pink";
canvasContext.strokeStyle = "red";
canvasContext.lineWidth = 10;
```

Note:
- Must be called before the stroke() method

---

### clearRect() to Erase

``` js
// Clears a rectangle from the canvas
canvasContext.clearRect(0, 0, 50, 50); 

// Clears the whole canvas
canvasContext.clearRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height) 
```

***clearRect(x, y, width, height):*** Clears a rectangular area, making it transparent.


Note:
- Here is an example of a clearRect, that clears a rectangle area, making it transparent. Can be useful for ereasing elements from the rectangle.

---

### Canvas width and height

``` js
<canvas id="myCanvas" width="300" height="150"></canvas>
```

Note:
- It is possible to specify the width and height of a canvas like this
- If these are not specified, the default size is 300x150

---

### Canvas width and height

``` js
<canvas id="myCanvas"></canvas>

const canvas = document.getElementById("myCanvas");
const canvasContext = canvas.getContext("2d");

canvas.width = 300;
canvas.height = 150;

// the whole window/viewport inner width
canvas.width = window.innerWidth;
canvas.height = window.innerHeight;

```

Best to add straight to canvas or programatically add in javascript based on screen size

Don't use css as it can stretch the pixels

Note:
- If we want the size of it to be dynamic we can do that in javascript. We can set it there.
- It's not recommended to use css to size the canvas, as that will just take the default size 300x150 and stretch it out.
- If we want to to take up the whole page height, we can do this.

---

### possible eventListeners

``` js
canvas.addEventListener("mousemove", function(event) {
   // ... something that happens on every mousemove
})

// "mousedown, "mouseup", "mousemove", "click", 
// "mouseleave", "mouseover" ...

```

Note:
- Just to re visit, the eventListener function.
- We have been using it for the past week, but we have perhaps not used all its events. 
- Here are some more events we might want to know for today. 

---
### How to get the mouse position on the canvas

``` js
canvas1.addEventListener("mousedown", function (event) {
  // returns the size of the canvas and its position relative to the viewport.
  const rect = canvas1.getBoundingClientRect();
  const mouseXPosition = event.clientX - rect.left;
  const mouseYPosition = event.clientY - rect.top;

  drawCircle(canvas1Context, mouseXPosition, mouseYPosition, 100);
});
```

<img src="attachment/c11/position2.png" height="300px">

Note:
- From the event object we get from our mousedown event. We have access to event.clientX to know the x position of the mouse on the viewport or the window
- then we can use the getBoundingClientRect to get where the Canvas is on the viewport.
- Then we can subtract the left of the canvas from the position of the mouse. Then we see where you are at the canvas.
- As the canvas coordinate will start at 0, 0
