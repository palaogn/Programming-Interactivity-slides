## 03/ History of the web

How the Web Evolved to Becoma an Interactive Prayground

<img src="attachment/c1/internet-history.jpg" />

Note: 

---

### The first webpage 1991

<img src="attachment/c1/first_web_page.png" />


Note: This is the first webpage ever built. WorldWideWeb was the first web browser and editor. It was dicontinued in 1994. When it was written, it was the only web browser that existed as well as the first HTML editor.

---

### Mosaic Browser 1993
<img src="attachment/c1/mosaic_browser.png">

Note: The mosaic browser, later Netscape Navigator was released in 1993. It was a graphic browser, this was the first web brwser aiming to bring multimedia content to non-technical users. And therefore included images and text on the same page, unlike previous browser design.

---

### Internet Explorer 1995

<img src="attachment/c1/internet_explorer.png" width="500px"/>

Note: This is the Internet Explorer that came out in 1995. But it kind of took over the market after that.

---

### CSS released 1996

<img src="attachment/c1/css.jpg" />

Note: Before CSS there was just HTML to style pages. But they did have these HTML style tags.

---

## Who in here is older then Google?

<img src="attachment/c1/google.png" width="600px"/>

Note: Started 1996 but first released 1998.
</br></br>
Im kind of suprised how the layout is kind of the same today.

---

The web was only viewed by desktop computers

<img src="attachment/c1/desktop.png"/>

Note: The web was only viewed by desktop computers

---

### Iphone announcement 2007

<img src="attachment/c1/iphone.png" />

---

### 320 x 420

<img src="attachment/c1/iphone_size.png" />

---

### RWD - Responsive Web design

One website - all screen sizes

<img src="attachment/c1/all_sizes.png" />

Note: Ethan Marcotte coined the term responsive web design. And defined it to mean fluid grid/ flexible images/ media queries. In a articel in may 2010 in A List Apart. Thats already 3 years after the launch of iphone.

---

### Social media

---

### Facebook 2004

<img src="attachment/c1/facebook.png" />

---

### Youtube 2005

<img src="attachment/c1/youtube.png" />

---

### Twitter / X 2006

<img src="attachment/c1/twitter-2006.png" />

---

### Instagram 2010

<img src="attachment/c1/instagram.jpg" />

---

### Snapchat 2011

<img src="attachment/c1/snapchat.png" />

---

### Musical.ly / TikTok 2016

<img src="attachment/c1/tiktok.jpg" />

---

<img src="attachment/c1/social_media.jpg" />

Note: These mainstream social media have made a big impact of interactivity on the web. Facebook, Twitter and Instagram I think is safe to say, started the infinite scrolling trend. At one point you would finish, but at some point they made it infinie. 
</br></br>
Then Tiktok came with the short intension span tapping. (that is making the world less patient, or more quick).
</br></br>
These have quite a big impact on the interaction on the web today. As these patterns are used all over the internet now. People get used to them and start to learn the pattern. Same with the pattern of navigation on aa page. (Top bar, burger menu, you will most of the time go up)

---

### Facebook like button

introduced in 2009


<img src="attachment/c1/Facebook_Like_btn.png" />

Note: Followed with comments in 2010.
</br></br>
There was talks about a "dislike" button
</br></br>
Then followed by reactions in 2016, with emotions including "Love", "Haha", "Wow", "Sad", or "Angry"

---

### Facebook reaction buttons

introduced in 2016

<img src="attachment/c1/reaction-buttons.jpg" />


---

## 04/ Future of interactivity

Note: Well you tell me, I don't know. Does anyone actually know.

---

The most dangerous phrase in the language is, 

***We've always done it this way***


#### - Grace Hopper (1906-1992)

<img src="attachment/c1/grace-hopper.webp" width="400px"/>

Note: Grace Hopper was an american computer scientist and mathematician.
</br></br>
She was a pioneer of computer programming

---

That's why I have a clock on my wall that runs counter-clockwise.

#### - Grace Hopper

<img src="attachment/c1/counter-clockwise.jpg" width="400px">

Note: Well, a counter clocwise clock runs the same way as a normal clock.
</br></br>
I actually bought myself a anti clockwise clock as a reminder of this

---

### Grace Hopper

Believed that programming should be simplified with an English-based computer programming language
</br>
</br>

Had the idea and wrote the first ***compiler***

<img src="attachment/c1/grace_hopper_2.jpg" width="300px"/>

Note: Hopper believed that programming should be simplified with an English-based computer programming language. She proposed the idea of writing programs in words, but she was told her idea would not work.
</br></br>
Compiler is something that translated a human like language, or code that humans understand into machine code that machines can understand.
</br></br>
Cobol came out 1959.
</br></br>
This has spiraled into tech today, today we can say Hey Siri

---

This mindset is important today!

How can we make Interactions simple

Note: Technology has made so many things easier for us. But it is getting harder every day. Its easy to create a complex software, its hard to create a easy one. There is a big value in keeping it simple. Easy does not mean, less advanced.
</br></br>
Good UX, simplify progress, the simplify mindset

---

<img src="attachment/c1/keep_it_simple_stupid.png"/>

Note: The KISS principle. The term was first used in the US Navy and is thought to have been coined by Kelly Johnson, who was the lead engineer at the Lockheed Skunk Works

---

#### Grace Hopper 

Also found the world first computer ***bug***

which was a literal insect, it was a moth

<img src="attachment/c1/computer-bug.jpg" height="400px" />

Note: The team at Harvard University in Cambridge, found that their computer, the Mark II was delivering consistent errors. 
</br></br>
When they opnened the computer's hardware, they found a moth. The trapped insect had disrupted the electronics of the computer.
</br></br>
Debug

### What is the future of interacting with the web today?

---

### Computer Keyboard

Most known is QWERTY keyboard layout, same as the typewriter

<img src="attachment/c1/typewriter.webp">

Note: If we look at the computer, we mainly interact with it by the computer keyboard and the mouse. We have physical mouse and the touchpad.
</br></br>
What is interesting about computer keyboard is that the most common layout the QWERTY keyboard layout. Was initially developed for typewriters. Commonly used letters were spreaded out to reduce the amount of times the printing hammers got jammed.
</br></br>
But its interetsting, why are we using the same layout still today? is this the best layout to use. Or have we just always done it this way.

---

### Airplain keyboard

<img src="attachment/c1/plane-keyboard.jpeg" />

Note: This is a keyboard that pilots need to use in plains, the keys are actually alphabetical. This is the same layout we see fx on a television.

---

### Smartphone keyboards

<img src="attachment/c1/smartphone_keyboard.jpeg" />

Note: Then there is the smartphone keyboards. That are just virtual keyboards, also mainly of the QWERTY standart.

---

### Keypad phone

<img src="attachment/c1/Telephone-keypad.png" />

Note: Then previously we had the keypad phones. I have to admit that I miss that keyboard, I liked that more then the current smartphone keyboard. You can type without looking at the keyboard.

---

Quadstick
<section data-background-iframe="https://www.quadstick.com/" data-background-interactive>

Note: This is a company that specializes in accessible remotes for people with disibilities that perhaps can't use a normal keyboard or a mouse. This remotes can all be controlled from your face. They include a joystick, they can be pressed with tongue, they have blowing tubes, chin button and more.
</br></br>
This is interesting what is the future of interacting with the web. Will I still be hurting my shoulders or hand by using a keyboard. Or will I be able to use other methods, such as eyes, mouth, toes.


---

Interactivity is a broad term and I hope we can learn more about it together!

Note: 

---

#### So that you can be the pioneers of the future of interactivity

Lets learn how to program it and what material do we have to work with

Note: By material in this concept I mean HTML, CSS, browsers, key inputs, keyboard, mouse, controls
</br></br>
We can use that to change the flow of the web, we can change how things look, make things move, create new hardware for interations. Possibilities are endless

---
